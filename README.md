Big Mart Sales Prediction is a machine learning project designed to forecast future sales based on historical data by analyzing both product attributes and store-level factors. The goal is to identify key elements that influence sales performance and provide insights that can help retailers improve decision-making, optimize inventory management, and increase revenue. Traditional forecasting methods rely on basic demand tracking, which often fails to capture changing market patterns, whereas this project applies predictive analytics using models such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Trees, and ultimately XGBoost, which delivers the most accurate results. The dataset includes attributes like product ID, weight, fat content, visibility, category, price, outlet details, establishment year, size, location type, and outlet type, all of which are used to train the models. By combining these variables, the system predicts future sales and highlights the factors that most significantly impact them, allowing businesses to adjust product and store characteristics strategically. This demonstrates the practical value of machine learning in retail sales forecasting, enabling companies to understand consumer behavior better and build more effective business strategies.
